%The first widely adopted haplotype inference method was Clark's Subtraction Method (Clark, 1990). This method is a greedy approximation method that aims to minimize the number of unique haplotypes in the solution. Due to its greedy nature, Clark's Subtraction Method is dependent on the ordering of the genotypes in the input. The number of genotypes that are resolved can vary for different orderings. There are n! possible orderings of n genotypes. Consequently, 60 genotypes can be ordered in 8 x 10^81 different ways. (Note that it has been estimated that there are approximately 10^80 subatomic particles in the entire known universe!)
