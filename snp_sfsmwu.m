%
%Mann-Whitney U-test (MWU) applied to the frequency spectrum can be used to
%test for an excess or deficiency of low-frequency derived alleles (Akashi
%1999).
%
%MWU should be performed using the folded, and not the unfolded frequency
%spectrum, because use of the unfolded frequency spectrum involves
%additional assumptions regarding the outgroup species and may be sensitive
%to mis-specifications of ancestral states ().
