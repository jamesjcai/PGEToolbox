% The haplotype test of HUDSON et al. (1994) was calculated using a program
% provided by J. Braverman. This test compares the observed configuration
% of segregating sites among haplotypes with that expected under neutrality.
% This comparison is done by partitioning the data into two groups of
% sequences and determining the probability of observing i sequences with j
% or fewer segregating sites. Partitions that maximized i and minimized j
% were chosen and corrected for the a posteriori choice of i and j by
% including the probability of all possible configurations more extreme
% than that observed. Probabilities of summary statistics and of
% configurations of the haplotype test were determined from 10,000 random
% coalescent simulations with no recombination, conditioned on the observed
% number of segregating sites.
