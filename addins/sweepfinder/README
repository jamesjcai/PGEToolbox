This program reads in SNP data with locations along a chromosome.  It creates
a grid of locations over this region, and at each location, calculates
the maximum composite likelihood ratio (CLR) statistic comparing the 
hypothesis of a complete selective sweep at the location to the null 
hypothesis of no sweep.  The likelihiood function is the "parameteric approach"
described in the reference (eq 6).  It outputs the CLR statistic as well as 
the parameter alpha (the strength of the sweep) to an outfile.  Small values
of alpha correspond to strong sweeps.

The size of the grid is controlled by the user.  The CLR statistic can
fluctuate quite a bit along the length of the chromosome, so care should
be taken that the grid is sufficiently dense that no large peaks appear 
when the gridsize is increased.  

The significance of the maximum CLR in a region should be determined by
analyzing data from neutral simulations which have the same sample size
and SNP density.  When analyzing the neutral simulations, the same gridsize
should be used as when the real data is analyzed.

Main usage
---------------------------------------------------------------
The main way to use the program is with the command:
./SweepFinder -s GRIDSIZE snp_filename out_filename
Then, the program will read in the snps, optimize the frequency spectrum,
and then analyze the likelihood function along a grid of size GRIDSIZE.
The output file will have GRIDSIZE lines with the columns:
1. location	
2. maximum CLR at location
3. alpha corresponding to maximum CLR



Input format
----------------------------------------------------------------
The snp file should be a tab-delimited file with column headers, and
one row per SNP.  One column header should be "x" (the frequency of the
SNP), another should be "n" (the sample size, must be greater than x), and
another should be "position" (the chromosomal location of the SNP).  
Optionally, a fourth column named "folded" can be added.  If it is present,
than a value of one indicates that the SNP is folded (there is no distinction
between ancestral/derived states), and 0 means unfolded.  If the folded
column is not present, all SNPs are assumed to be unfolded.
Column names do not actually contain quotes.  A sample input file might look
something like:

position        x       n	folded
37.000000       10      46	0
145.000000      3       47	0
277.000000      1       47	1
385.000000      37      43	1
469.000000      2       45	0
585.000000      1       44	0
733.000000      10      45	0



Running on simulated data from ms
-----------------------------------------------------------------
(http://home.uchicago.edu/~rhudson1/source/mksamples.html)

use the command
./SweepFinder -m GRIDSIZE ms_filename out_filename 

This will sequentially read in each sample, optimize the frequency
spectrum for that sample, and then analyze the CLR function at GRIDSIZE
points.  Rather than outputting the value of the CLR function at every
point for each sample, it only outputs the maximum CLR for each sample.
The output file will have the columns:
1. Sample number
2. maximum CLR in sample
3. location of maximum CLR in sample
4. alpha corresponding to max CLR

If you'd rather use the same frequency spectrum to analyze each of the
ms runs, use the command:
./Sweepfinder -M GRIDSIZE ms_filename freq_filename out_filename



Using a different frequency spectrum
------------------------------------------------------------------
The default behavior of the program is to use the maximum likelihood
estimate of the frequency spectrum for each dataset.  In some cicumstances,
it might be desirable to calculate the frequency spectrum on a different
dataset.  For example, if you want to analyze many autosomal regions 
separately, you might want to first combine all the data, obtain the 
frequency spectrum, and use the same spectrum for each analysis.  This could
result in a gain in power.
To calculate the frequency spectrum, use the command:
./SweepFinder -f snp_filename freq_filename

The freq_file will be over-written with the frequency spectrum.

You can also provide your own frequency spectrum at your own risk.  The 
format of the frequency spectrum file is two columns, an integer (the 
frequency), and a floating-point number (the proportion of SNPs with that 
frequency).  The integer values should range from 1 to n-1, where n is the
maximum sample size in your dataset.

To run the program using a precomputed frequency spectrum, use the command
./SweepFinder -l GRIDSIZE snp_filename freq_filename out_filename

The snp_file and out_file should have the same format as described in the
main usage section.
