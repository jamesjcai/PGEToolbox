INSTALLATION PROCEDURES FOR hweStrata

hweStrata is written in the C programming language, and tested on
Sun workstations with Solaris operating system (Sun Ultra-80; sparc, 
SunOS Releases 5.9 and 5.10), CentOS 4.3 Linux x86-64, and on 
Microsoft Windows XP. The source code is bundled for distribution, and
the bundle contains executables for Solaris, Linux, and Windows.

  UNIX/LINUX SYSTEMS:

  To unpackage the software for unix systems, follow the series of commands:

  1) gunzip hweStrata_x.y.tar.gz
  2) tar -xvf hweStrata_x.y.tar
  3) cd hweStrata

  The pre-compiled executables are in the bin directory. To compile an 
  executable on Solaris or Linux, do "cd src", then type "make".


  WINDOWS SYSTEMS:

  Uncompress hweStrata_x.y.tar.gz (using WinZip, for example) to a known
  location.

  The executable is in the bin directory.  If you move the executable,
  CC2370.DLL must either be moved with it, or contained in the PATH 
  environment variable. This included .dll file must be named exactly
  as it appears in this paragraph (all caps).

  The program can be run using the command prompt.  


DOCUMENTATION

User documentation is in the doc directory, and an example input and
output file are in the example directory.
