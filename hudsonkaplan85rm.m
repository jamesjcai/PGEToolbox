%R_M, denotes the minimum number of recombination events implied by
%the data using the four-gamete test
%R, denotes the total number of recombination events in the history of
%the sample.

% We describe here an algorithm for determining RM. Recall the matrix D =
% (d(i, j)), where d(i, j ) = 1 if all four gametes involving sites i and j
% are present in the sample; otherwise d(i, j) = 0. To each nonzero element
% d(i, j) of D above the diagonal we associate the open interval (i, j) and
% form a list of these intervals ordered so that the starting points of the
% intervals are not decreasing. The method for finding RM deletes certain
% members of this list. The first type of intervals deleted are those that
% completely contain other intervals. For example, if (i, j ) and (m, n)
% are on the list, and m <= i < j <= n then (m, n) is deleted. For the
% remaining intervals on the list, let (i2, j2) be the first interval with
% i2>=j1 such that (i2,j2) is not disjoint from all of the remaining
% intervals and delete all intervals whose first component is <j2 and >i2.
% This process is continued until it is not possible to find an interval
% that has a nonempty intersection with some other interval on the list. At
% this point all of the intervals are disjoint, and to each interval we
% must assign at least one recombination event. Hence, RM equals the final
% number of intervals on the list.
